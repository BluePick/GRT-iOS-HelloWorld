# GRT-iOS-HelloWorld

The [Gesture Recognition Toolkit](https://github.com/nickgillian/grt) is a "cross-platform, open-source, C++ machine learning library 
designed for real-time gesture recognition". This repository contains the project outlined in my blog post, Integrating the GRT into an 
iPhone app - Part One.
