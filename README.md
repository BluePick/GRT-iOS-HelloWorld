# GRT-iOS-HelloWorld
An example of how to integrate the Gesture Recognition Toolkit into an iPhone app


The [Gesture Recognition Toolkit](https://github.com/nickgillian/grt) is a "cross-platform, open-source, C++ machine learning library 
designed for real-time gesture recognition". This repository contains the project outlined in my blog posts, [Integrating the GRT into an 
iPhone app](https://www.nickarner.com/blog/2017/8/21/integrating-the-grt-into-an-iphone-app) and [Machine-Learning powered Gesture Recognition on iOS](https://www.nickarner.com/blog/machine-learning-powered-gesture-recognition-on-ios).
